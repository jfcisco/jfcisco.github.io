My web dev journey in one HTML document.


## Installation
To copy the environment I developed this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install devDependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start browser-sync.

I included browser-sync in the project because it makes it easier for me to look at how the changes I make to the document's markup or styling affect the appearance of the site.
