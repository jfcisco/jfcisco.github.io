		<h1>Jasper's Portfolio</h1>
		<p>I graduated with a bachelors in Management Engineering from the Ateneo de Manila University. My course, though primarily oriented in business, is a great help to a career in web development because it taught me communication and collaboration skills as well as the context to ground my design decisions on what the company truly needs. I also earned a certification in front-end web development from the non-profit organization Free Code Camp. Web development is my passion and I worked for the certification in my free time during college. I am looking for a company I can grow with, where I can learn from the best, and make great contributions to its bottom line. </p>
